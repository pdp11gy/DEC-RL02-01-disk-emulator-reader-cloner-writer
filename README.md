Final Version:                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
SoC/HPS based RL01/RL02 disk emulator/reader/cloner/(writer), Altera Cyclone V FPGA with ARM Cortex-A9 (DE10-Nano) 
The operation of the RL02/RL01 emulator is best viewed with a VIDEO via YouTube, however in the first version from **2012**, based on the DE1-Board. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i3ypBU39as
                                                                                                                                              
**All sources with environment setup  are located in the zip-folder DE10_SoC_RL_emulator_V2_8.zip**                                                                                                                                               

With the new firmware version V2.8E it is also possible to clone a disk without a PDP-11 system.                                                        
The software runs completely on the DE10-Nano board and generates .dsk files for direct further                                                       
use with SIMH.
